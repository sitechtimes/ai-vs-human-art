    <h1>the best home page.</h1>
    <p>
      the most incredible home page anyone has ever seen. i had a little boy come up to me one
      evening. he told me "wow, you made the best home page i've ever seen!" and you know what i
      told him? because i don't know what i told him. i activated the trapdoor beneath his feet and
      sent him to the dungeon
